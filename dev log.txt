ver 3
  goal: 
    Make the PCB smaller and cheaper based on the previous version (using ESP32, bluetooth)
  choose IC: 
      NRF24L01P-R: This time, I want to try using an RF module for communication (to reduce costs). After consulting ChatGPT and considering the amount of reference material available online, I decided to use this IC.
      DRV8837DSGR: Although using this IC will require two separate ICs to drive the motors, I suspect this might make routing and layout easier. Even with two ICs, the cost is only a quarter of the old solution (though there might be unforeseen issues during implementation :) ).
